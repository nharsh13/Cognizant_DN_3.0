Why are data structures and algorithms essential in handling large inventories?

# Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial in an inventory management system to ensure quick access to product information, updates, and removal.
 This helps in maintaining accurate inventory levels and reduces the time complexity of operations.

# The choice of data structure impacts the performance of operations such as adding, updating, and deleting products.
  An efficient data structure ensures that these operations are performed quickly, even with a large number of products.

Types of data structures suitable for this problem:

ArrayList: Good for dynamic arrays that provide fast access to elements. However, insertion and deletion can be slow as elements need to be shifted.

HashMap:   Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups,
           making it suitable for storing product information where each product can be identified by a unique key (product ID).

 ANALYSIS:
Time Complexity Analysis:

Adding a Product:

Operation: inventory.put(product.getProductId(), product);
Time Complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap provides constant time complexity for insertion.
Updating a Product:

Operation: inventory.put(productId, updatedProduct);
Time Complexity: O(1) on average because updating a value in a HashMap is similar to insertion.
Deleting a Product:

Operation: inventory.remove(productId);
Time Complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap provides constant time complexity for removal.
Retrieving a Product:

Operation: inventory.get(productId);
Time Complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap provides constant time complexity for lookup.           

Optimization Discussion:

HashMap Efficiency: Using a HashMap is already optimized for average case scenarios due to its O(1) time complexity for the basic operations (add, update, delete, retrieve). 
                    Ensuring a good hash function and managing hash collisions efficiently will keep the performance optimal.
Concurrency: If the inventory system needs to handle concurrent access by multiple threads, consider using ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap to ensure thread safety without 
             significant performance degradation.
Load Factor and Capacity: When using a HashMap, tuning the initial capacity and load factor can help in reducing the number of rehash operations,
                           thereby optimizing performance.
Indexing: If more complex queries or range-based retrievals are required, consider combining a HashMap with other data structures,
           such as a TreeMap for sorted order, to handle such cases efficiently.
